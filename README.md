Shania and Gaeel are doing Ludum Dare
=====================================


## Concept

The game is a text-heavy interactive fiction set in a modern espionage universe, with possibly some magic or paranormal elements.   
The player interacts with the game through a hacking terminal, and must manipulate the system to gain access to various mainframes and secured networks. As the player progresses, intrigue is revealed in documents found on the compromised computers.


## Tech

A browser game, pure HTML5/JS, server is NodeJS.   
Game is networked, so occasionally, players may encounter other hackers, and may choose to avoid or confront them.


## Theme justification (You only get one)

### Story
Waiting for Shania to wake up to make story decisions.

### Gameplay   
You only get one...   
+ Attempt. *Fail and you must start over. ProcGen?*
+ Clue. *Clues are given sparingly*
+ Not sure really, gameplay-wise, this theme is shite...
